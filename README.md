# Signlanguage_Translator
This is a signlanguage translator created on Jupyter notebook, using ANN which also consists of sounds of alphabets so that communication can be done between blind, mute and deaf people.
This code also consist of LDA and PCA for comparison purposes but majorly we will be using sequential dense model from Tensorflow for our ANN.
High Accuracy for model can be expanded onto in the future
